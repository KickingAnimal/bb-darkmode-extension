#Git repo for darkmode extensions, BlackBoard.hanze.nl

extension(s) for BlackBoardCollaborate (Hanze UAS) that overwrite the CSS for a darkmode apperance. 

first wroking on the extension for Firefox, after for chromium based browsers.

would maybe work on bb for other institutions but no way of testing, limited to domains of the Hanze UAS.
